medicine\nFamily medicine[note 1] is a medical specialty within primary care\nthat provides continuing and comprehensive health care for the\nindividual and family across all ages, genders, diseases, and parts\nof the body .[2][3] The specialist, who is usually a primary care\nphys ician, is named a family physician.[note 2] It is often referred\nto as general practice and a practitioner as a general practitioner.\nHistorically, their role was once performed by any doctor with\nqualifications from a medical school and who works in the\ncommunity. However, since the 1950s , family medicine / general\npractice has become a specialty in its own right, with specific\ntraining requirements tailored to each country.[4][5][6] The names of\nthe specialty emphasize its holistic nature and/or its roots in the\nfamily. It is based on know ledge of the patient in the context of the\nfamily and the community, focusing on disease prevention and\nhealth promotion.[7] According to the World Organization of\nFamily Doctors (WONCA), the aim of family medicine is\n\"promoting personal, comprehensive and continuing care for the\nindividual in the context of the family and the community\".[8] The\nissues of values underlying this practice are usually know n as\nprimary care ethics.\nFamily physicians in the United States must hold either an M.D. or\na D.O. degree. Physicians who specialize in family medicine must\nsuccessfully complete an accredited three or four year long family\nmedicine residency in the United States in addition to their medical\ndegree. They are then eligible to sit for a board certification\nexamination, which is now required by most hospitals and health\nplans.[9] American Board of Family Medicine requires its\ndiplomates to maintain certification through an ongoi ng process of\ncontinuing medical education, medical know ledge review, patient\ncare oversight through chart audits, practice-based learning through\nquality improvement projects and retaking the board certification\nexamination every 7 to 10 years. The American Osteopathic Board\nof Family Physicians requires its diplomates to maintain\ncertification and unde rgo the process of recertification every 8\nyears.[10]\nPhysicians certified in family medicine in Canada are certified\nthrough the College of Family Physicians of Canada,[11] after two\nyears of additional education. Continuing education is also a\nrequirement for maintenance of certification.Scope of practice", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2947, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f6ecea1-d579-48a0-94ec-6ff4f16ef689": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f6ecea1-d579-48a0-94ec-6ff4f16ef689", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9a5728be-228f-46e5-a5b2-800678c48292", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "hash": "5fd4c767f4b374c41fb49d024719e29c0a13f7e3505054853f839021fce9ce96", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "83ed6fcf-edb7-4b38-b51a-77711c802649", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "hash": "2f5b522b21251bef9e7598cfb7254b59e9ff0723533190a1a76da3197eaf78f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fed37e03-2c56-45d7-81a7-9b9ba7008f29", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1466bc77394d0d4277e6c9c7fb5cfda34180a8389806bc3024b5bb59dcf907cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Bachelor of\nMedicine,\nBachelor of\nSurgery\n(MBChB)\nDoctor of\nOsteopathic\nmedicine (D.O.)\nFields of\nemploymentHospitals, clinics,\nemergency\ndepartments, long-\nterm careThe term \"family medicine\" or \"family physician\" is used in the\nUnited States, Mexico, South America, many European and Asian\ncountries. In Sweden, certification in family medicine requires five\nyears working with a tutor, after the medical degree. In India, those\nwho want to specialize in family medicine must complete a three-\nyear family medicine residency, after their medical degree\n(MBBS). They are awarded either a D.N.B. or an M.D. in family\nmedicine. Similar systems exist in other countries.\nGeneral practice is the term used in many other nations, such as the\nUnited Kingdom , Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Such\nservices are provided by general practitioners. The term primary\ncare in the UK may also include services provided by community\npharmacy, optometrist, dental surgery and community hearing care\nproviders. The balance of care between primary care and\nseconda ry care - which usually refers to hospital-based services - varies from place to place, and with time.\nIn many countries there are initiatives to move services out of hospitals into the community, in the\nexpectation that this will save money and be  more conve nient.\nFamily phys icians deliver a range of acute, chronic, and preventive medical care services. In addition to\ndiagnos ing and treating illness, they also provide preventive care, including routine checkups , health-risk\nassessments, immunization and screening tests, and personalized couns elling on maintaining a healthy\nlifestyle. Family phys icians also manage chronic illness, often coordinating care provided by other sub-\nspecialists.[12] Family doctors also practice safety-netting, which involves follow-up assessments for\nuncertain diagnos es associated with symptoms that could innoc uous, but may also be a sign of serious\nillness.[13][14] Many American Family Physicians deliver babies and provide prenatal care.[15] In the U.S.,\nfamily physicians treat more patients with back pain than any other physician sub-specialist, and about as\nmany as orthope dists and neurosurgeons combined.[16]\nFamily medicine and family phys icians play a vital role in the healthcare system of a country. In the U.S. for\nexample, nearly one  in four of all office visits are made to family phys icians. That is 208 m illion of fice visits\neach year \u2014 nearly 83 million more than the next largest medical specialty. Today, family physicians\nprovide more care for America's unde rserved and rural popul ations than any ot her medical specialty.[17]\nIn Canada, aspiring family phys icians are expected to complete a residency in family medicine from an\naccredited university after obtaining their Doctor of Medicine degree.

At the same time, many medical advances were being made and there was concern within the\n\"general practitioner\" or \"GP\" popul ation that four years of medical school plus a one-year internship was\nno longe r adequate preparation for the breadth of medical know ledge required of the profession.[19] Many\nof these doctors wanted to see a residency program added to their training; this would not only give them\nadditional training, know ledge, and pr estige but would allow for board certification, w hich was increasingly\nrequired to gain hospital privileges.[19] In February 1969, family medicine (then know n as family practice)\nwas recognized as a distinct specialty in the U.S. It was the twentieth specialty to be recognized.[19]\nFamily physicians complete an unde rgraduate degree, medical school, and three more years of specialized\nmedical residency training in family medicine.[20] Their residency training includes rotations in internal\nmedicine, pediatrics,[21] obstetrics-gyne cology, psychiatry, surgery, emergency medicine, and geriatrics, in\naddition to electives in a wide range of other disciplines. Residents also must provide care for a panel of\ncontinuity patients in an outpatient \"model practice\" for the entire period of residency.[22] The specialty\nfocuses on treating the whole person, acknowledging the effects of all outside influences, through all stages\nof life.[23] Family physicians will see anyone  with any problem, but are experts in common problems.\nMany family phys icians deliver babies in addition to taking care of patients of all ages.\nIn order to become board certified, family phys icians must complete a residency in family medicine, possess\na full and unrestricted medical license, and take a written cognitive examination.[24] Between 2003 and\n2009, the process for maintenance of board certification in family medicine is being changed (as well as all\nother American Specialty Boards) to a series of yearly tests on differing areas. The American Board of\nFamily Medicine, as well as other specialty boards, are requiring additional participation in continuous\nlearning and self-assessment to enhance clinical know ledge, expertise and skills. The Board has created a\nprogram called the \"Maintenance of Certification Program for Family Physicians\" (MC-FP) which will\nrequire family phys icians to continuous ly demonstrate proficiency in four areas of clinical practice:\nprofessionalism, self-assessment/lifelong learning, cognitive expertise, and performance in practice. Three\nhundr ed hours of continuing medical education within the prior six years is also required to be eligible to sit\nfor the exam.[25]In the United States\nHistory of medical family practice\nEducation and training", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3487, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9bb5b809-9a77-487c-b085-c05cc01183b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "9bb5b809-9a77-487c-b085-c05cc01183b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b98ba895-de17-44ba-b549-26b16fd9c829", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "hash": "6f6f10eff1016e398fb33382e56ca16f32c50152d35b6809807619d71a190ae7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fed37e03-2c56-45d7-81a7-9b9ba7008f29", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "hash": "9cb66cecf22befc992afcd39e52f975dcf4789bbc9f3d9a4315d602df497f05b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "95ce08e0-d3ef-40ea-acc5-cf60e449029c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "50dd9ca4e3bc5a9ea20141e0dda599d973f9bd52851b06f06db62989050f8385", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Family phys icians may pursue fellowships in several fields, including adolescent medicine, geriatric\nmedicine, sports medicine, sleep medicine, hospital medicine and hospice and palliative medicine.[26] The\nAmerican Board of Family Medicine and the American Osteopathic Board of Family Medicine both offer\nCertificates of Added Qualifications (CAQs) in each of these topics.[27]\nMany sources cite a shortage of family phys icians (and also other primary care providers, i.e. internists,\npediatricians, and general practitioners).[28] The per capita supply of primary care phys icians has increased\nabout 1 percent per year since 1998.[29] A recent decrease in the number of M.D. graduates pursuing a\nresidency in primary care has been offset by the number of D.O. graduates and graduates of international\nmedical schools (IMGs) who enter primary care residencies.[29] Still, projections indicate that by 2020 the\ndemand for family phys icians will exceed their supply.[29]\nThe number of students entering family medicine residency training has fallen from a high of 3,293 in 1998\nto 1,172 in 2008, according to National Residency Matching Program data.

To reach that figure 4,439 family physicians must complete their residencies\neach year, but currently, the nation is attracting only half the number of future family physicians that will be\nneeded.[31]\nTo address this shortage, leading family medicine organizations launched an initiative in 2018 to ensure that\nby 2030, 25% of combined US allopathic and osteopathic medical school seniors select family medicine as\ntheir specialty.[32][33] The initiative is termed the \"25 x 2030 Student Choice Collaborative\", and the\nfollowing eight family medicine organizations have committed resources to reaching this goal:\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians Foundation\nAmerican Board of Family Medicine\nAmerican College of Osteopathic Family Physicians\nAssociation of Departments of Family Medicine\nAssociation of Family Medicine Residency Directors\nNorth American Primary Care Research Group\nSociety of Teachers of Family Medicine\nThe waning interest in family medicine in the U.S. is likely due to several factors, including the lesser\nprestige associated with the specialty, the lesser pay, the limited ACGME approved fellowship\noppor tunities, and the increasingly frustrating practice environment. Salaries for family physicians in the\nUnited States are lower than average for physicians, with the average being $234,000.[34] However, when\nfaced with debt from medical school, most medical students are opting for the higher-paying specialties.\nPotential ways to increase the number of medical students entering family practice include providing relief\nfrom medical education debt through loan-repayment programs and restructuring fee-for-service\nreimbursement for health care services.[35] Family physicians are trained to manage acute and chronic\nhealth issues for an individual simultaneously, yet their appointment slots may average only ten minutes.[36]Shortage of family physicians", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3428, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95ce08e0-d3ef-40ea-acc5-cf60e449029c": {"__data__": {"id_": "95ce08e0-d3ef-40ea-acc5-cf60e449029c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "65354a45-4ac3-4763-b6ba-136267fd1e37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "hash": "985147de5c52e5901c90880f0e5d81e3e830f843a73280373e5276a389ba976d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9bb5b809-9a77-487c-b085-c05cc01183b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "hash": "6f6f10eff1016e398fb33382e56ca16f32c50152d35b6809807619d71a190ae7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d74497f0-f5fd-483e-b166-76d32e7bdee7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6f516f4d19c42a43162f160ffc1823a83288076a19daab2fc870dd15774ddb7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Paper based patient records at\nWhalsay Health Centre 2012In addition to facing a shortage of personne l, physicians in family medicine experience some of the highest\nrates of burnout among m edical specialties, at 47 pe rcent.[37]\nMost family phys icians in the US practice in solo or small-group private practices or as hospital employees\nin practices of similar sizes owned by hospitals.

Every patient was\nentitled to be on the list, or panel of a general practitioner. In 1911 that only applied to those who paid\nNational insurance contributions. In 1938, 43% of the adult popul ation was covered by a panel doctor.[39]\nWhen the National Health Service was established in 1948 this extended to the whole popul ation. The\npractice would be respons ible for the patient record which was kept in a \"Lloyd George envelope\"[40] and\nwould be transferred if necessary to another practice if the patient changed practice. In the UK, unlike many\nother countries, patients do not normally have direct access to hospital consultants and the GP controls\naccess to seconda ry care.[41]\nPractices were generally small, often single handed, operating from\nthe doctor's home and often with the doctor's wife acting as a\nreceptionist.[42] When the NHS was established in 1948 there were\nplans for the building of  health centres, but few were built.\nIn 1953, general practitioners were estimated to be making between\n12 and 30 home visits each day and seeing between 15 and 50\npatients in their surgeries.[43]\nToday, the services are provided unde r the General Medical\nServices Contract, which is regularly revised.\n599 GP practices closed between 2010\u2013 11 and 2014\u201315, while 91 opened and average practice list size\nincreased from 6,610 to 7,171.[44] In 2016 there were 7,613 practices in England, 958 in Scotland, 454 in\nWales and 349 in Northern Ireland.[45] There were 7,435 practices in England and the average practice list\nsize in June 2017 was 7,860.

There is a move to incorporate other health professionals such as\npharmacists in to general practice to provide an integrated multidisciplinary healthcare team to deliver\nprimary care.[74]\nFamily medicine (FM) came to be recognized as a medical specialty in India only in the late 1990s .[75]\nAccording to the National Health Policy \u2013 2002, there is an acute shortage of specialists in family medicine.\nAs family phys icians play a very important role in providing affordable and universal health care to people,\nthe Government of India is now promoting the practice of family medicine by introduc ing post-graduate\ntraining through D NB (Diplomate National Board) programs.\nThere is a severe shortage of postgraduate training seats, causing a lot of struggle, hardship and a career\nbottleneck for newly qualified doctors just passing out of medical school. The Family Medicine Training\nseats should ideally fill this gap and allow more doctors to pursue family medicine careers. However, the\nuptake, awareness and de velopment of this specialty is slow.[76]\nAlthough family medicine is sometimes called general practice, they are not identical in India. A medical\ngraduate who has successfully completed the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS), course\nand has been registered with Indian Medical Counc il or any state medical counc il is considered a general\npractitioner. A family phys ician, however, is a primary care physician who has completed specialist training\nin the discipline of family medicine.\nThe Medical Counc il of India requires three-year residency for family medicine specialty, leading to the\naward of Doctor of Medicine (MD) in Family Medicine or Diplomate of National Board (DNB) in Family\nMedicine.\nThe National Board of Examinations conduc ts family medicine residency programmes at the teaching\nhospitals that it accredits. On successful completion of a three-year residency, candidates are awarded\nDiplomate of National Board (Family Medicine).[77] The curriculum of DNB (FM) comprises: (1) medicine\nand allied sciences; (2) surgery and allied sciences; (3) maternal and child health; (4) basic sciences and\ncommunity health. During their three-year residency, candidates receive integrated inpatient and outpatient\nlearning. T hey also receive field training at community health centres and clinics.[78]\nThe Medical Counc il of India permits accredited medical colleges (medical schools) to conduc t a similar\nresidency programme in family medicine. On successful completion of three-year residency, candidates are\nawarded Doctor of Medicine (Family Medicine).[79][80] A few of the AIIMS institutes have also started a\ncourse called MD in community and family medicine in recent years. Even though there is an acute\nshortage of qualified family phys icians in India, further progress has been slow.\nThe Indian Medical Association's College of General Practitioners, offers a one-year Diploma in Family\nMedicine (DFM), a distance education programme of the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine, University of\nColombo, Sri Lanka, for doctors with minimum five years of experience in general practice.[81] Since the\nMedical Counc il of India requires three-year residency for family medicine specialty, these diplomas are not\nrecognized qua lifications in India.\nAs India's need for primary and seconda ry levels of health care is enormous, medical educators have called\nfor systemic changes to include family medicine in the unde rgraduate medical curriculum.[82] Some projects\nlike \"Buzurgo Ka Humsafar\" aid in the growing need for primary care by conduc ting social awareness\nworkshops  and adult vaccination camps.[83]India", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3705, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "985fce10-3410-4d11-9770-a56a950cd4e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "985fce10-3410-4d11-9770-a56a950cd4e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "89b579f4-0aca-4930-aa66-1a6bbe040b4a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "hash": "2d812023aa40d92de2e3350d14a1a4ec7607bf43b55d069634d30aa12655b1e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3304dbf-e9ee-4ac8-a5f9-47d092822af2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "hash": "46467a6ab9ffaf75eced464fd524b82ff7a72d4b2b7de6a751df78a4b150f470", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "55290eea-3eeb-42e2-a282-776b2b7923a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "975b4eb11a376a4458c9c7d9409c0372145731cc82844101372574c35054f554", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Recently, the residency-trained family phys icians have formed the Academy of Family Physicians of India\n(AFPI). AFPI is the academic association of family physicians with formal full-time residency training\n(DNB Family Medicine) in Family medicine. Currently there are about two hundr ed family medicine\nresidency training sites accredited by the National Board of Examination India, providing around 700\ntraining posts annua lly. However, there are various issues like academic acceptance, accreditation,\ncurriculum development, uniform training standards, faculty development, research in primary care, etc. in\nneed of urgent attention for family medicine to flourish as an academic specialty in India. The gove rnment\nof India has declared Family Medicine as focus area of human resource development in health sector in the\nNational Health Policy 2002[84] There is discussion ongoi ng to employ multi-skilled doctors with DNB\nfamily medicine qualification against specialist posts in NRHM (National Rural Health Mission).[85]\nThree possible models of how family physicians will practise their specialty in India might evolve, namely\n(1) private practice, (2) practising at primary care clinics/hospitals, (3) practising as consultants at\nseconda ry/tertiary care hospitals.\nA group of 15 doctors based in Birmingha m have set up a social enterprise company - Pathfinder\nHealthcare - which plans to build eight primary health centres in India on the British model of general\npractice. According to Dr Niti Pall, primary health care is very poor ly developed in India. These centres will\nbe run commercially. Patients will be charged \u20b9 200 to 300 for an initial consultation, and prescribed only\ngeneric drugs, dispensed from attached pha rmacies.[86]\nFamily medicine was first recognized as specialty in 2015 and currently has approximately 500 certified\nfamily doctors.[87] The Japanese gove rnment has made a commitment to increase the number of family\ndoctors in an effort to improve the cost-effectiveness and quality of primary care in light of increasing health\ncare costs.[88] The Japan Primary Care Association (JPCA) is currently the largest academic association of\nfamily doctors in Japan.[89] The JPCA family medicine training scheme consists of a three-year programme\nfollowing the two-year internship.[87] The Japanese Medical Specialty Board define the standard of the\nspecialty training programme for board-certified family doctors. Japan has a free access healthcare system\nmeaning patients can bypa ss primary care services. In addition to family medicine specialists Japan also has\n~100,000 organ-specialist primary care clinics.[88] The doctors working in these clinics do not typically\nhave formal training in family medicine. In 2012, the mean consultation length in a family medicine clinic\nwas 10.2 minutes.[90] A review literature has recently been published detailing the context, structure,\nprocess, and out come of family medicine in Japan.[91]\nEconomics portal\nMedicine portal\nATC codes \u2013 Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System\nClassification of Pharmaco-Therapeutic Referrals\nGeneral practice\nICD-10 \u2013 International Classification of Diseases\nICPC-2 PLUSBritish model\nJapan\nSee also", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3229, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55290eea-3eeb-42e2-a282-776b2b7923a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "55290eea-3eeb-42e2-a282-776b2b7923a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66d0020b-4fa3-4270-a0de-355b734de808", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "hash": "f938f9fea88cf4f9f4ecfbf9ad6c20b8d6101a748a757ddc310f792549f57b3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "985fce10-3410-4d11-9770-a56a950cd4e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "C:/Users/yuval/PycharmProjects/ai/data/Family_medicine.pdf"}, "hash": "2d812023aa40d92de2e3350d14a1a4ec7607bf43b55d069634d30aa12655b1e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8caed602-8b96-43b7-864c-db77c41050f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8de7c7d721d60efebd8906a06ea4c444efa6967f6a278bece208590944936382", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "International Classification of Primary Care ICPC-2\nPrimary care\nReferral (medicine)\nWalk-in clinic\n1.
